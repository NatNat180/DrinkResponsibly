<h1>Welcome To Drink Responsibly!</h1>
<h2>Important Information Before You Begin</h2>
	<p>This app is intended to give you a responsible drinking game plan for a night out 
	(or in). The information provided was made possible through careful research of 
	standard blood alcohol level charts based on gender and weight. While the 
	information was carefully calculated and the results aim for game plans 
	within reason, it is important to note that not everybody is the same.
	If you feel at all unsure on if you should have another drink, simply refrain. 
	This app is not intended to be a game to reach a high-score in!</p>
	<h3>In This App, One Drink Is The Equivalent Of Any One Of These</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>12 fl oz of beer</li>
			<li>5 fl oz of glass wine</li>
			<li>1.5 fl oz shot of liquor (80 proof)</li>
		</ul>
	<p>If you plan on drinking something with more alcohol content than the above 
	listed drinks, take that into account and drink even less. Be smart about it!</p>
	<h3>IMPORTANT: WHETHER YOU HAVE ONE SIP OR SEVERAL DRINKS, DO NOT DRINK AND DRIVE - ALWAYS HAVE A DESIGNATED DRIVER WHEN YOU PLAN TO DRINK - 
	KEEP YOURSELF AND OTHERS SAFE FROM HARM. THANKS!</h3>
